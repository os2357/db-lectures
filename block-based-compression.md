## In-Depth Analysis

### Technical Foundations
- **BtrBlocks**: Fixed blocks and SIMD-driven decompression excel in predictable, scan-heavy workloads (e.g., data lake scans over S3). Sampling (1–10%) trades adaptability for speed.
- **Umbra**: Operator fusion and runtime adaptation optimize end-to-end latency, leveraging hardware (e.g., cache, NVMe). Speculative ML lacks evidence but aligns with trends.
- **COMPASS**: Clustering-based adaptability suits diverse data, though preprocessing overhead may limit throughput compared to BtrBlocks or ALP.
- **MGARD**: Multigrid decomposition ensures fidelity, ideal for scientific data, but its complexity hampers raw performance.
- **Data Blocks**: Vectorized execution and lightweight compression bridge OLTP/OLAP, akin to Umbra but less adaptive.
- **Parquet (Adv.)**: Ecosystem compatibility and emerging adaptability (e.g., GPU decoding) make it a practical baseline, though slower than specialized systems.
- **ALP**: Vectorized, two-stage compression rivals BtrBlocks in speed and ratio, optimized for numerical data.

### Performance Metrics
- **Decompression Throughput**:  
  - BtrBlocks leads (2–4 GB/s), followed by ALP (2–3 GB/s) and Umbra/Data Blocks (~1.5–2 GB/s). MGARD (<1 GB/s) lags due to complexity.
- **Compression Ratio**:  
  - MGARD (3–5×) excels with fidelity trade-offs; COMPASS (2–4×) and Umbra/ALP (2.5–3.5×) follow. BtrBlocks and Parquet (2–3×) prioritize speed over ratio.
- **Cost Efficiency**:  
  - BtrBlocks and ALP minimize CPU cost (~$0.01/GB); Umbra reduces I/O; MGARD’s compute cost is high but offsets storage.

### Benchmark Insights
- **TPC-H (Analytical)**: BtrBlocks and ALP dominate scans (Q1, Q6); Umbra and Data Blocks excel in joins (Q3).
- **TPC-C (Mixed)**: Umbra and Data Blocks handle hybrid workloads; BtrBlocks and ALP falter in random access.
- **Real-World (NYC Taxi)**: COMPASS adapts to skewness (3–4× ratio); MGARD preserves precision; Parquet ensures compatibility.

### Hardware Considerations
- **CPU**: BtrBlocks and ALP leverage SIMD (e.g., AVX-512); Umbra optimizes for cache/NVMe.
- **GPU**: Parquet’s enhancements and Umbra’s potential lead; others require adaptation.
- **Portability**: ALP and Parquet are hardware-agnostic; BtrBlocks is Intel-centric.
